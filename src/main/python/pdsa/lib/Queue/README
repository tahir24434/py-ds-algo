6.2.2 Array-Based Queue implementation
--------------------------------------
To implement queue, we can use adapter class that uses a Python list as the underlying
storage. We can use pop(0) to remove the first element from the list while dequeuing.
As easy as this would be to implement, it is tragically inefficient. When pop is called with
a non-default index, a loop is executed to shift all elements beyond the specified index to
the left, so as to fill the hole in the sequence caused by the pop. Therefore a call to pop
(0) always causes the worst-case behavior of O(n) times.

Implementation using array circularly:
