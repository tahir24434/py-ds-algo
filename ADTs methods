6.1.1 Stack Abstract Data Type:
-------------------------------
Formally a stack is an abstract data type such that an instance S supports following methods:
S.push(e):      Add element e to the top of the stack.
S.pop()  :      Remove and return the top element from the stack S;
                An error occurs if stack is empty

Additionally, let us define the following accessor methods
S.top():        Return a reference to the top element of stack S, without removing it;
                an error occurs if stack is empty.
S.is_empty():   Returns True if stack S does not contain any elements.
len(S):         Return the number of elements in stack S;
                in python we implement this with special method __len__.
